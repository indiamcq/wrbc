The timer needs to start at 9:45 for a normal 10am Sunday service. There is a wrbc-10am-timer.cmd file that can be started anytime up until 10:45am. After that ime it will fail. This script will close if it is not Sunday.

There is a second script that is set to start a time for a 9am service like on Easter and Christmas day. The script checks for 2022 to 2026 Easter dates and for Christmas day.
The ini file has the setting to place the time and WRBC logo on the projector screen in the correct place and start a15 min timer countdown.
