The timer needs to start at 9:45 for a normal 10am Sunday service. There is a wrbc-timer-starter.cmd file that can be started anytime up until 9:45am. After that time it will fail. This script will work on Sundays, but if it is Christmas Day or Easter Friday then the script will start at 8:45. Currently the script will check for Easter Friday up to 2032.
The ini file has the setting to place the time and WRBC logo on the projector screen in the correct place and start a15 min timer countdown.
